# Assignment 3

Each team has a topic along with a description. Choose one of the design patterns below;

```
● Chain of Responsibility
● Command
● Iterator
● Mediator
● Memento
● Observer
● State
● Strategy
● Template Method
● Visitor
```
You are not required to develop the project (for example, if the project is about to create an

Android app, then it does not mean that you have to create an Android project. It means you

should take into account the aspects of mobile development when creating your classes). It is

about implementing the design pattern within the context of the project. You may choose any

feature (functionality) of your project. If you think the description does not contain a feature to

implement the design pattern, you are free to add a feature to the project within the context of the

topic.

**Your work should contain the followings;**

1. UML class diagram - (weight 35 %)
2. Code - (weight 50 %)
3. Report - (weight 15 %)

**Steps**

1. Create a UML diagram (preferably in draw.io) for a given topic.
2. Implement the UML using Java.
3. Write a report describing steps 1, 2, and the reasons why the team chose the design
    pattern.


**Each team needs to submit a zipped folder containing the following;**

1. UML class diagram in image or pdf format (if it is too big, then you can put a link to the
    UML diagram in your report).
2. A report in pdf format.
3. A zipped file containing the source code (written in JAVA).

**How can our team obtain a high grade?**

```
● UML
○ Good class naming
○ The part that is responsible for pattern application is highlighted
○ Fields/methods are reflected in the diagram according to the project's
implementation (no need to define many fields/methods, include only the
necessary).
○ Types should be consistent with:https://www.uml-diagrams.org/data-type.html
○ Relationships between classes should also be defined (if there is an association,
name it and include it). Example:https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class.html.If
there is a relationship between different classes, indicate them in class
field/method(for example, if class A has the instance of class B, then indicate
class B as a field in class A).
○ No classes ‘hanging in the air’. All classes must be somehow associated with each
other.
● Implementation
○ Pure Java (no frameworks, no libraries, no dependencies)
○ Source code should be consistent with your UML diagram
○ Code is not messy (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
○ README (provide the steps for executing your project)
○ Ensure the methods and properties in the UML diagram are included in your code
○ Code is documented where possible / where necessary
● Report
○ Shorty introduce the project context/task
○ Clearly and shortly justifies why you chose the particular pattern
○ Describes the job you have done in UML 1st and your source code 2nd
○ Specifies the place of the pattern in your code
○ Avoids grammar and spelling errors making it easy to understand and read
○ Conveys meaning (when necessary with details) of what and why you are doing
in your project
○ Finally, describes the application of a particular pattern in a crystal clear way
without relying on ‘obviousness’ or knowledge of patterns of the reviewer.

#Electricity billing system

The main task of designing software is to automate something with greater efficiency. In our day-to-day lives, one of the biggest systems that are in dire need of automation is the billing system for electricity. Till today, bills are generated manually after readings are taken. Work done to automate reading meters and generating bills will go a long way in ensuring work is done in the most efficient way possible while ensuring accuracy in the numbers quoted on the bills.
